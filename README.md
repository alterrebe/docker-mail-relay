Postfix Mail Relay
======================

Contains:

* Postfix, running in a simple relay mode
* RSyslog

Processes are managed by supervisord, including cronjobs

The container provides a simple proxy relay for environments like Amazon VPC where you may have private servers with no Internet connection
and therefore with no access to external mail relays (e.g. Amazon SES, SendGrid and others). You need to supply the container with your 
external mail relay address and credentials. The configuration is tested with Amazon SES.
